# App
Bubble chart integration with Scanner
This will integrate CODE of BUBBLECHART HTML for showing Data as volume/trade bubbles.
I want in show this chart with all these information collected from WSS of UPSTOX and is used for better understanging BIG volume of BIG player is coming and not retail volume.

BubbleChart.html : This file had logic to connect to local ws in same app , which is broadcasting all ticker data
app.py : have all logic for SQZ fired and consuming UPSTOX WSS data and broadcasting WS for bubble chart

Currently Canvas of chart ( Bubble chart heml shows empty ) 

I want to fix 
Blank Canvas issue.
